# Antigravity on Horizon Cloud Workstation images

Horizon integrates two **separate** Google Antigravity products into workstation images:

| Product | Version line | Purpose | Images |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| **Antigravity 2.0 Agent** (desktop) | 2.x | GUI agent via GNOME app menu | `horizon-gnome` base (inherited by `horizon-android-studio`; `horizon-asfp` installs it directly until it migrates onto the `horizon-gnome` base) |
| **Antigravity CLI (`agy`)** | 1.x | Terminal agent | `horizon-code-oss` (required) |

Antigravity IDE is **not** installed. Gemini Code Assist on workstation images is **unchanged** by Antigravity tooling.

For MCP Gateway Registry setup with Antigravity, use `antigravity-mcp-agent` (Antigravity Agent and CLI). Gemini clients continue to use `gemini-mcp-agent`. See [MCP Setup and Usage Guide](../../../guides/mcp_setup.md#mcp-client--tool-mapping) and the [image matrix](#image-matrix) below.

**Architecture note:** the Agent is a single, shared build step baked into the `horizon-gnome` base image (behind `INSTALL_ANTIGRAVITY_AGENT`, default `true`) so every GNOME thin-child inherits it without re-installing. `horizon-android-studio` is a thin child of `horizon-gnome` and no longer installs the Agent itself. `horizon-asfp` has not yet migrated onto `horizon-gnome` and still installs the Agent directly in its own Dockerfile; when it migrates, that duplicate install should be removed in favor of inheriting it from the base. `horizon-code-oss` does not derive from `horizon-gnome` and is unaffected - it only installs the CLI.

Install scripts live under:

`workloads/cloud-workstations/pipelines/workstation-images/common-utils/antigravity/`

Build-time install scripts for **Antigravity 2.0 Agent** (desktop) and **Antigravity CLI (`agy`)** on Horizon workstation images.

| Script | Used on | Installs |
|---|---|---|
| `install-antigravity-agent.sh` | `horizon-gnome` base image (inherited by Android Studio); `horizon-asfp` directly until migrated | Antigravity **2.0 Agent** (not IDE) |
| `install-antigravity-cli.sh` | on Code OSS image | `agy` CLI (pinned GitHub release tarball) |

Scripts run at **image build time** (root). **OAuth / first sign-in** happen at **runtime** in the browser (Chrome is in GNOME images).

## Image matrix

| Jenkins image job | Agent (desktop) | CLI (`agy`) | Launch desktop |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Horizon GNOME (base) | Yes (source of the install) | Yes (bundled with the agent) | N/A (base image only) |
| Horizon Android Studio | Yes (inherited from `horizon-gnome`) | Yes (bundled with the agent) | GNOME menu → Antigravity 2.0 |
| Horizon Android Studio for Platform (ASfP) | Yes (installed directly, not yet migrated) | Yes (bundled with the agent) | GNOME menu → Antigravity 2.0 |
| Horizon Code OSS | No | Yes | N/A (terminal: `agy`) |

**Note:** `agy` still appears on GNOME workstations (e.g. `/usr/bin/agy`) from Google’s CLI installer. It is installed by default. That is independent of `install-antigravity-cli.sh`, which installs to `/usr/local/bin/agy`.

## Build pipelines

Image jobs under `Cloud Workstations → Workstation Images` copy `common-utils/antigravity/` at build time. Set versions from each job’s **Build with Parameters**:

- **Antigravity CLI (`agy`)** — **Horizon Code OSS**. Provide `ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_VERSION`, `ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_TARBALL_URL`, and `ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_SHA256`. Release assets and SHA-256 digests are listed on the [Antigravity CLI releases](https://github.com/google-antigravity/antigravity-cli/releases) page.
- **Antigravity 2.0 Agent** (desktop) — **Horizon Android Studio** and **Horizon Android Studio for Platform (ASfP)** (GNOME-based IDE images). Provide `ANTIGRAVITY_2_VERSION`, `ANTIGRAVITY_2_TARBALL_URL`, and `ANTIGRAVITY_2_TARBALL_SHA256`.

| Parameter | Horizon GNOME (base) | ASfP (not yet migrated) | Code OSS |
|-----------|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------|
| `INSTALL_ANTIGRAVITY_AGENT` | Required, default `true` | N/A | — |
| `ANTIGRAVITY_2_VERSION` | Required (e.g. `2.2.1`) | Required (e.g. `2.2.1`) | — |
| `ANTIGRAVITY_2_TARBALL_URL` | Linux x64 tarball URL | Linux x64 tarball URL | — |
| `ANTIGRAVITY_2_TARBALL_SHA256` | SHA-256 of that tarball (lowercase hex) | SHA-256 of that tarball (lowercase hex) | — |
| `ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_VERSION` | — | — | Required (e.g. `1.1.0`) |
| `ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_TARBALL_URL` | — | — | GitHub release asset URL (e.g. `agy_cli_linux_x64.tar.gz`) |
| `ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_SHA256` | — | — | SHA-256 of that tarball (lowercase hex) |

`horizon-android-studio` no longer has its own `ANTIGRAVITY_2_*` parameters - it consumes whatever Agent build was baked into the `horizon-gnome` image it references via `BASE_IMAGE`. To upgrade the Agent version for Android Studio, rebuild/republish `horizon-gnome` with the new `ANTIGRAVITY_2_*` parameters first, then point Android Studio's `BASE_IMAGE` at the new base tag/digest.

Defaults are set in each image `Dockerfile` and matching Jenkins `job.groovy`.

When changing either the CLI or the Agent version, you **must** supply all three corresponding values (version, tarball URL, and SHA-256). Updating only the version (or omitting URL/SHA) causes Antigravity installation to fail at image build time.

## Runtime (workstation)

### Desktop Agent (AS / ASfP)

1. Open workstation via noVNC.
2. Launch **Antigravity 2.0** from the app menu (no autostart).
3. Complete Google sign-in in Chrome when prompted.

### CLI (Code OSS)

```bash
agy --version
agy
```

## Session persistence
Login tokens live under `/home/user/…`.  
Enable persistent disk on the workstation config (PD_REQUIRED=true, mount /home) so OAuth survives stop/start.  
Without PD, expect sign-in again after restart.

## Workstation config notes
* Use lowercase config names (GCP requirement).
* Android Studio / ASfP images are large; use `HOST_BOOT_DISK_SIZE ≥ 31 GB`. "Start Workstation" fails at any value less than 31 GB.

## Install scripts
### `install-antigravity-agent.sh`
Desktop 2.0 Agent with a GPU-safe X11 wrapper, compatible with both TigerVNC/X11 (ASfP, standalone) and RDP/XWayland (GNOME-based images such as Android Studio).
```bash
ANTIGRAVITY_2_INSTALL_MODE=tarball \
ANTIGRAVITY_2_VERSION=2.2.1 \
ANTIGRAVITY_2_TARBALL_URL=<url> \
ANTIGRAVITY_2_TARBALL_SHA256=<sha256> \
./install-antigravity-agent.sh
```
Creates:

| Path  | Role  |
|------|----------|
|/opt/antigravity/ | Real binary (tarball mode) |
|/usr/local/bin/antigravity | GPU-safe X11 wrapper |
|/usr/share/applications/antigravity.desktop | App menu entry |

Does not create `/etc/xdg/autostart/antigravity.desktop` entry.

### `install-antigravity-cli.sh`

Installs via pinned CLI install from a GitHub release tarball (not the floating install.sh).
```bash
ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_VERSION=1.1.0 \
ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_TARBALL_URL=<url> \
ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_SHA256=<sha256> \
./install-antigravity-cli.sh
```
Installs to `/usr/local/bin/agy` after SHA-256 verification.  
Example release: [antigravity-cli 1.1.0](https://github.com/google-antigravity/antigravity-cli/releases/tag/1.1.0)

## Build-time smoke checks
Agent (Dockerfile of the image that runs `install-antigravity-agent.sh`):
```bash
test -x /usr/local/bin/antigravity
test -f /usr/share/applications/antigravity.desktop
grep -q 'MimeType=.*x-scheme-handler/antigravity' /usr/share/applications/antigravity.desktop
! test -f /etc/xdg/autostart/antigravity.desktop
```
The `MimeType` line is written by `install-antigravity-agent.sh` itself. Callers should assert it wherever they install the Agent; it is not owned by Android Studio or ASfP specifically.
CLI (Dockerfile):

```bash
agy --version
```

## Known issues
### Antigravity OAuth requires Chrome launcher + `antigravity://` handler (TAA-2017)
Sign-in opens a browser and redirects to `antigravity://oauth-success`. Chrome must be reachable via `/usr/local/bin/google-chrome-stable` on `horizon-gnome` (wrapper after the package divert). The Agent installer registers `MimeType=x-scheme-handler/antigravity;` in `antigravity.desktop`. Without those, the Agent stays on "Awaiting Authentication..." or GNOME reports no app for the URI. Fixed under TAA-2017.

### GNOME Keyring unlock can block Antigravity token storage (TAA-2017)
The Agent stores OAuth tokens via Secret Service. Guacamole/RDP does not PAM-unlock the login keyring. `setup_keyring()` in `horizon-gnome` must unlock the session `gnome-keyring-daemon` (blank password) without starting a second conflicting daemon. Fixed under TAA-2017.

### Antigravity Desktop App v2.0 fails to reopen after being closed, requires force termination
- **What is expected:** Antigravity should close completely when dismissed. When the Antigravity icon is clicked, it should reopen without any issues.
- **What happens:** Closing the Antigravity window does not fully quit the app. A background process stays running (single-instance Electron-style lifecycle). The next click on the app menu starts another launch attempt, which sees that process and tries to hand off to it instead of starting cleanly — but the window never comes back. No error is shown.
  Fixing this properly needs a product change in Antigravity 2.0 (full quit on close, or restore the window on second launch).
- **Workaround:** Manually terminate the app. In a terminal on the workstation:
```bash
ps aux | grep -i antigravity
pkill -f antigravity   # or kill -9 <pid> if needed
```
