# <span style="color:#335bff">Workload Usage - Android</span>

This document covers the usage of **Android** Jenkins workloads.

It includes pointers to workload documentation under [`docs/workloads/`](../../workloads/) (job parameters and scripts are described there and in `workloads/*/pipelines/**/README.md`).

> **Note:** This setup document combines with the [workload_setup.md](workload_setup.md), [workload_usage.md](workload_usage.md) and [android_labs.md](android_labs.md) documents to supersede the former Android `docs/workloads/android/guides/developer_guide.md` (deprecated). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Android versions are updated regularly. Users should verify which releases are currently supported. Exercises in this guide may reference older versions; please update them to the latest supported release as appropriate.
> - When working with Cuttlefish, please be aware that the latest supported versions change frequently. The examples provided in this guide may become outdated, as <a href=https://github.com/google/android-cuttlefish/tags>tags</a> are updated regularly.

## <span style="color:#335bff">ANDROID BUILDS</span> <a name="builds"></a>

The Horizon SDV platform inherently supports building using public manifests so any version of Android can be built using the Google AOSP upstream manifest for example. Additionally, if a private repo has been set up in Gerrit, this can also be used to build from a custom manifest.

[ --- Collapsing Section --- ]::
<details><summary>Source Selection in Build Job</summary><hr width="50%">

| Source | Build Job Parameters <sup>*</sup>  | 
| --- | --- |
| Google AOSP | `AAOS_MANIFEST_URL` = `https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest` <br> `AAOS_REVISION` = any branch present in the AOSP repo. E.g. `android-14.0.0_r30` |
| Gerrit Repo | `AAOS_MANIFEST_URL` = `https://example.horizon-sdv.com/gerrit/android/platform/manifest` <br> `AAOS_REVISION` = any branch present in the gerrit repo. E.g. `horizon/android-14.0.0_r30` |

<sup>*</sup> _Example build job_: _Android Workflows_ → _Builds_ → _AAOS Builder_

<details id="build-devices-supported"><summary><b>Supported Devices (&amp; associated values)</b></summary><hr width="50%">
The following devices types are currently supported:

| Device Type | Target Prefix | Artifacts | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android Studio Virtual Device | `sdk_car_` | `sdk-repo-linux-system-images.zip`<br>`horizon-sdv-aaos-sys-img2-1.xml` | Android SDK AVD targets can be used to spin up virtual devices using the _Android Emulator_ in _Android Studio_.|

| Google Pixel Tablet | `tangorpro_car_` | `*out_sdv-aosp_tangorpro_car-*-userdebug.tgz*` | Android `tagoropro_car` system images can be used to flash [Google Pixel](https://source.android.com/docs/automotive/start/pixelxl) tablet devices. |
| Raspberry Pi | `aosp_rpi` | `*.img*`<br>e.g. `boot.img`, `system.img`, `vendor.img` | Android `aosp_rpi` system images can be used to flash Raspbery Pi devices. |

See the valid [Build Targets](#build-targets) options (in the _Other Build Topics_ section) for each device type/architecture/android version combination.

<hr width="50%"></details>

No matter which device is being built, the steps are the same:

[ --- Collapsing Section --- ]::
<details id="build-device-target"><summary><b>1. Build the Target:</b></summary><hr width="50%">

- Navigate to _AAOS Builder_ pipeline job (_Android Workflows_ → _Builds_ → _AAOS Builder_)
- Select `Build with Parameters`
- Use the gerrit manifest url provided as default
    - e.g. `https://example.horizon-sdv.com/gerrit/android/platform/manifest`
- Enter the required target for `AAOS_LUNCH_TARGET` (determines what type of build will take place, and which images are created)
    - See the valid [Build Targets](#build-targets) options (in the _Other Build Topics_ section) for each device type/architecture/android version combination
- Enter the required branch for `AAOS_REVISION` 
    e.g. `horizon/android-16.0.0_r3`
- Click `Build`

<hr width="50%"></details>

[ --- Collapsing Section --- ]::
<details id="build-get-artifacts"><summary><b>2. Download / Note the Build Artifacts</b></summary><hr width="50%">

- Wait for build to complete successfully (green tick in _Builds_ summary section)
- Open the artifacts text file (e.g. `*-userdebug-artifacts.txt`) which will indicate the location of the build artifacts.
- Download the artifacts if required (use the download commands in the artifacts file); otherwise, note the storage location.

<hr width="50%"></details>


[ ========================== ]::
### <span style="color:#335bff">Build the CTS Test Suite</span> <a name="build-cts"></a>

By default, the [CTS Execution](../android/tests/cts_execution.md) test job uses the Android CTS versions [provided by Google](https://source.android.com/docs/compatibility/cts/downloads), which are pre-installed on the VM instances used to launch Cuttlefish Virtual Devices. 

However, users can also build their own version of this test suite and use that instead.

- To build the CTS test suite, [Build the Target](#build-device-target) for a cuttlefish device, but with `AAOS_BUILD_CTS` parameter set to true; this builds only the test suite, not the target images.

- The output file does not need to be downloaded - simply note the google storage location (e.g. `gs://<BUCKET_ID>/Android/Builds/AAOS_Builder/03/android-cts.zip`); it can be used directly in the [CTS Execution](../android/tests/cts_execution.md) test job (instructions [here](#testing-cts-custom)).




[ ========================== ]::
### <span style="color:#335bff">Other Build Topics</span> <a name="build-other"></a>



[ --- Collapsing Section --- ]::
<details id="build-targets"><summary>Build Targets</summary><hr width="50%">

Android lunch targets are specified by the build parameter [`AAOS_LUNCH_TARGET`](../android/builds/aaos_builder.md#targets); they specify not only the device type, but also the android version, device architecture and required build variant: `<TargetPrefix_TargetArchitecture_AndroidReleaseIdentifier_BuildVariant>`

**Target Prefix** - Builds determine their functionality (e.g. setup, build args, archives) based on the LUNCH target prefix which changes by target type.

| Target Prefix | Device Type |
| --- | --- |
| `sdk_car*` | SDK Virtual Device targets |
| `aosp_cf*` | Cuttlefish Virtual Device targets |
| `*tangorpro_car*` | Pixel Tablet platform support |
| `aosp_rpi*` | Raspberry Pi targets (based on Vanilla RPi builds) |

- Unsupported target types provided to build jobs will be built using the default make command `m` (can be [overridden](../android/builds/aaos_builder.md#environment-variables) using the `OVERRIDE_MAKE_COMMAND` build parameter); however, no artifacts will be stored because the expected output files are not defined.

**Target Architecture** - Whether the target device is `arm` or `x86` also needs to be taken into consideration when the lunch target is specified.

**Android Release Identifier** - The device binaries used are version dependent - determined by the _release identifier_ (or _build release string_) - e.g. `ap1a`, `ap2a`, `ap3a`, `bp1a`, `bp3a`, `bp4a`. Currently-supported values are as follows:

| Android Version | Device Binary | Recommended for Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| android-14.0.0_r30 | `ap1a` | yes |
| android-15.0.0_r4 | `ap3a` | no |
| android-15.0.0_r20 | `bp1a` | no |
| android-15.0.0_r32 | `bp1a` | no |
| android-15.0.0_r36 | `bp1a` | yes |
| android-16.0.0_r3 | `bp3a` | yes |
| android-16.0.0_r4 | `bp4a` | no |

This page lists the [Codenames, tags, and build IDs](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/reference/build-numbers) associated with each version of Android; to determine which _release identifier_ to use, inspect the _Build ID_ associated with the selected android version.

<details id="build-make"><summary>Over-riding Make Commands in Builds</summary><hr width="50%">

The Android Build jobs allow users to override the default make commands using the parameter `OVERRIDE_MAKE_COMMAND` (more info [here](../android/builds/aaos_builder.md#environment-variables)) for scenarios where the default is not sufficient.
- Example: when updates to the HAL have been made: `m android.hardware.automotive.vehicle.property-update-api && m dist`

See [this](android_labs.md#override-make) lab exercise which shows an example of its use.

[ --- Collapsing Section --- ]::
<details id="devices-cuttlefish-launch"><summary><b>Launch the Virtual Device</b></summary><hr width="50%">

- Navigate to _CVD Launcher_ pipeline job (`Android Workflows` → `Tests` → `CVD Launcher`)
- Select `Build with Parameters`
- Set `JENKINS_GCE_CLOUD_LABEL` = name of cloud to link to appropriate Instance Template (needs to match architecture)
  - Available clouds can be viewed in the Jenkins UI: `Settings` &rarr; `Clouds`.
- Set `CUTTLEFISH_DOWNLOAD_URL` = location of the cuttlefish target images 
    - e.g. `gs://<BUCKET_ID>/Android/Builds/AAOS_Builder/25`
    - Note that `CUTTLEFISH_DOWNLOAD_URL` is a Google Storage (gs) path and not a file or https url.
- Enable the `CUTTLEFISH_INSTALL_WIFI` option
- Set `CUTTLEFISH_KEEP_ALIVE_TIME` to the time you need to keep the virtual devices alive for
- Set `NUM_INSTANCES` to the number of devices you want to spin up; these will run in parallel and can be used to spread / shard testing across devices to optimise test run time.
- Wait for job to enter the `Keep Devices Alive` stage; the cuttlefish virtual devices are now alive and ready to be used. 

The virtual devices can be viewed and interacted with in _MTK Connect_ (_https://example.horizon-sdv.com/mtk-connect/docs/_); see MTK Connect usage instructions [here](workload_usage.md#appendix-mtk-connect-testbench-access).

See here for more info on [Pixel devices as development platrforms](https://source.android.com/docs/automotive/start/pixelxl).

>[!IMPORTANT] Unlocking the bootloader **_erases all data_** on the device.

**Prerequisites:** 
- `adb` and `fastboot` installed on local PC.
- Charging cable should be unplugged - if plugged in, see [tip](#pixel-tips)

[ --- Collapsing Section --- ]::
<details id="devices-pixel-unlock"><summary><b>Unlock Device</b></summary><hr width="50%">

- Enable **Developer options** from `Settings > System > About` and then tap `Build Number` seven times.
- Enable **USB debugging** and **OEM unlocking** from `Settings > System > Developer options`

<hr width="50%"></details>


[ --- Collapsing Section --- ]::
<details id="devices-pixel-flash"><summary><b>Flash Device</b></summary><hr width="50%">

- Unpack the artifacts on your machine:
  - e.g. `tar -zxf out_sdv-aosp_tangorpro_car-bp1a-userdebug.tgz`
- Navigate to the location of the unpacked tar file
- Define `ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT` so that `fastboot` can detect the `fastboot-info.txt` file and images to flash. (We do not have `LUNCH` target nor the full `OUT_DIR` hence we define the environment variable for `fastboot`.)
    - e.g. `export ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT=out_sdv-aosp_tangorpro_car-bp1a-userdebug/target/product/tangorpro`
    - If a windows user and not using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) then replace `export` with `set`.

- Place the device into fastboot mode and then unlock it
```
adb reboot bootloader
fastboot flashing unlock
```
- On the device, select `Unlock the Bootloader`. Doing so **_ERASES ALL DATA_** on the device!

>[!NOTE]
> - The `adb reboot bootloader` command initiates a reboot of the Android device, specifying that the device should enter the bootloader mode upon restarting.
>
> **Key Combination:** Most devices require a specific key combination (e.g., pressing volume down while the device boots) to enter the bootloader mode. This combination needs to be pressed during the reboot process triggered by the `adb reboot bootloader` command.
>
> **Bootloader Activation:** The physical interaction with the device (pressing the key combination) is what actually forces the device to boot into the bootloader instead of its normal OS.

- To flash the build:
```
fastboot -w flashall
```
- After the build starts booting with animation:
- Enable adb remount:
    ```
    # Temporary disable the userdata checkpoint
    adb wait-for-device root; sleep 3; adb shell vdc checkpoint commitChanges; sleep 2
    # Enable remount
    adb remount && sleep 2 && adb reboot && echo "rebooting the device" && adb wait-for-device root && sleep 5 && adb remount
    ```
- Push the required Automotive-specific files to the device:
    ```
    adb sync vendor && adb reboot
    ```
- Wait for the device to boot to the home screen

- User may now setup networking on the device and play.

Android `aosp_rpi` system images can be used to flash Raspbery Pi devices.

[ --- Collapsing Section --- ]::
<details id="devices-rpi-create-image"><summary><b>Create a Flashable Image</b></summary><hr width="50%">

- Download the folowing bash scripts which will be used to create the flashable image - select the appropriate one for the RPi version you are targeting:
  - RPi5 [mkimg.sh](https://github.com/raspberry-vanilla/android_device_brcm_rpi5/blob/android-16.0/mkimg.sh) 
  - RPi4 [mkimg.sh](https://github.com/raspberry-vanilla/android_device_brcm_rpi4/blob/android-16.0/mkimg.sh)

- Run the script to create the flashable image:
  - it must be run on a host that supports loop devices (Horizon SDV build instances are Docker containers running in kubernetes and do not have the privileges to support loop devices). 
  Run as follows:
  ```

- Navigate to _CTS Execution_ pipeline job (`Android Workflows` → `Tests` → `CTS Execution`)
- Select `Build with Parameters` 
- Set `JENKINS_GCE_CLOUD_LABEL` = name of approprate Instance Template (needs to match architecture)
  - Available clouds can be viewed in the Jenkins UI: `Settings` &rarr; `Clouds`.
- Set `CUTTLEFISH_DOWNLOAD_URL` = location of the cuttlefish target images 
    - e.g. `gs://<BUCKET_ID>/Android/Builds/AAOS_Builder/25`
    - Note that `CUTTLEFISH_DOWNLOAD_URL` is a Google Storage (gs) path and not a file or https url.
- Enable the `CUTTLEFISH_INSTALL_WIFI` option if required
- Set `ANDROID_VERSION` to the version of Android that was used to build the target image specified in `CUTTLEFISH_DOWNLOAD_URL`; this will be used to select the appropriate test harness
- Set `NUM_INSTANCES` to the number of devices you want to spin up; these will run in parallel and can be used to spread / shard testing across devices to optimise test run time. Sharding will be done automatically if more than 1 device is selected.
- Set the CTS Parameters `CTS_TESTPLAN` and `CTS_MODULE` (see [here](../android/tests/cts_execution.md#environment-variables) for more info):
    - Set `CTS_TESTPLAN` to whichever value is appropriate for the Android version being used
    - Leave `CTS_MODULE` empty to run all modules, or set to an individual module (e.g. `CtsDeqpTestCases`) if desired. 
- Select `Build`

**Prerequisite:** Custom CTS test suite was already built and download location is known. See 
 [build](#build-cts) section for more info and instructions.

To perform testing using a custom-built CTS, follow the same proceedure as for the [default CTS run](#testing-cts-default) but in addition:
- Set `CTS_DOWNLOAD_URL` to point to your prebuilt CTS (e.g. `gs://<BUCKET_ID>/Android/Builds/AAOS_Builder/01/android-cts.zip`)
    - Note: ensure the full URL including `android-cts.zip` is used

This job will take longer than a job using the default CTS because it needs to download and unpack the custom `android-cts.zip` from Google Cloud Storage.

All artifacts are as per runs using the default CTS.

- A single module can be run when getting familiar with testing pipeline as the full test suite may take hours to complete.

- When multiple devices are used, the testing is spread over devices on a module-by-module basis, so if you want to see multiple devices being used for testing you will need to run a full CTS test plan (i.e. leave the `CTS MODULE` parameter empty)

- Running the pipeline with the parameter `CTS_TEST_LISTS_ONLY` ticked will skip the testing and simply generate a list of the test plan and test modules; this can be useful when selecting a test plan to execute. These lists are also generated by default as part of a full test run.

- Running the pipeline with the parameter `CTS_TEST_LISTS_ONLY` ticked will allow the user to view the devices during the testing process. However, interaction with the devices should be avoided as this would interfere with the testing process.

| Change Parameter | Where to find it |
| --- | --- |
| `Project` | hover on the 'Repo' link in the Properties panel |
| `Change Number` | top left corner of page - before the commit message |
| `Patchset Number`| In the panel showing 'Files', 'Comments' - e.g. `Patchset 1` |

[ --- Collapsing Section --- ]::
<details id="gerrit-change-id-topic"><summary><b>Using _Topic_ Property</b></summary><hr width="50%">

Changes can be identified in Gerrit using the `Topic` property. This is particularly useful for grouping multiple changes together, although it is still a valid identificaiton method for single changes.

Being able to group changes allows developers to test changes that span multiple repositories, ensuring that the changes can be tested together.

**Topic Assignment:**

- **Explicit Assignment on Change Page**
    - Select the 'edit' symbol next to the `Topic` field in the Properties panel.
    - Enter the desired topic value and click `SET TOPIC`
    
- **Assignment During Push Operation**
    - While pushing the change for review, append `%topic=<topic_name>` to the ref path:
        - e.g. `git push origin HEAD:refs/for/$(git branch --show-current)%topic=<topic_name>`

Regardless of the method of assignment, the new _Topic_ value should now show on the change page in Gerrit:

>[!NOTE:] 
> - A _Topic_ cannot be assigned to multiple changes simultaneously - it needs to be assigned to each individually
>- Click on the _Topic_ name to see all changes marked with the same _Topic_

The stardard build pipeline _AAOS Builder_ can be used to build using a Gerrit change or group of Gerrit changes for a particular target.

Specific changes can be selected either individually or as a group using the following Build job [Parameters](../android/builds/aaos_builder.md#environment-variables): 

| Parameter(s) | Single Change | Multiple Changes | Where to find values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

<details id="gerrit-build-triggered"><summary><b>Triggered Build</b></summary><hr width="50%">

The [_Gerrit_](../android/builds/gerrit.md) build pipeline can be used to test a Gerrit change or group of Gerrit changes; it builds for a fixed set of targets, spins up a virtual cuttlefish device and runs a basic CTS test run.

This job is triggered whenever the `Ready-for-Build` flag is set to +1 on a Gerrit patchset change; if the change is part of a _Topic_, all changes within that topic will be pulled into the triggered build.

**Recommended Reading:** How the _Gerrit_ job is [triggered](../android/builds/gerrit.md#triggers).

[ --- Collapsing SubSection --- ]::
<details id="gerrit-build-trigger-vote"><summary><b>Trigger Build by setting <i>Ready-for-Build</i> on a change</b></summary><hr width="50%">

- Open the change in the Gerrit application
    - Select `CHANGES` → `Open` → select your change (e.g.`Car Launcher weather app - sample update`).
- Hover on the `Ready-for-Build` item in the _Submit Requirements_ panel, then click on `VOTE READY-FOR-BUILD`
    - If you don’t see the `Ready-to_Build` label, ensure the correct [access](workload_setup.md#gerrit-project-access) permissions have been set
- The `Ready-for-Build` flag should now be set 
- A Gerrit build should have triggered 
    - It will be in the quiet period initially - see [more info](../android/builds/gerrit.md#triggers)
    - After the quiet period, the build begins and a _Build Started_ comment will be added to the _Change Log_ section of the Gerrit change page with a link to the triggered build job.    
    _Note: this will only appear for the change which triggered the build - not for the other changes in the topic_

Once a build has been executed and target images created, the desired target device can be launched (for a virtual device) or flashed (for a real device) in order to test the change that was made. 

E.g. For the example change made [here](#gerrit-change-edit) the name of the weather app would be expected to change - whether the change is 
- on a [virtual device in Android Studio](#devices-android-studio)
- on a [cuttlefish device](#devices-cuttlefish) viewed via [MTK Connect](workload_usage.md#appendix-mtk-connect-testbench-access) 
- flashed onto a [real pixel device](#devices-pixel).
