# Container Image Security Upgrade Guide

This guide explains how teams running their **own fork/mirror** of Horizon SDV on an **older release** can remediate the vulnerable OS packages that a container security scanner flags inside the platform's container images, and how to **test** the simpler upgrade path in an existing environment before adopting a new release.

There are **two kinds** of image upgrade. You can apply them **together** (one deployment) or **separately** (phased). Both are covered here.

> [!NOTE]
> This guide is written for **any** team consuming Horizon SDV. The image names, versions, and CVE examples are **illustrative**, taken from a real remediation batch — you do **not** need access to the issue tracker they came from. Map them to the findings in **your own** scanner report. Where a commit references an internal ticket ID, substitute your own.

## Overview

Every platform image is built by Terraform from a Dockerfile under `terraform/modules/sdv-container-images/images/...`, tagged with a version defined in [`terraform/modules/base/locals.tf`](../../terraform/modules/base/locals.tf), pushed to your Artifact Registry, and deployed by Argo CD.

A scanner finding falls into one of two categories:

| Kind | What it needs | Why |
|------|---------------|-----|
| **Type A - Rebuild / republish only** | A **version bump** (no source edit) | The Dockerfile already runs `apk upgrade` / `apt upgrade`, and Terraform builds with `no_cache = true`. The image was flagged only because the copy in your registry is **stale** (built before the patch was published). A fresh rebuild picks up the latest patched packages automatically. |
| **Type B - Code change** | Pull the fix from a **newer release** into your fork | The image does not self-heal on a plain rebuild - e.g. a Dockerfile that never runs `apk upgrade`, a **pinned base image** that must move (nginx), or an **interpreter/base bump** (Python). These fixes live in the platform source and ship in a later release. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A plain redeploy of the **same** image tag fixes nothing. Terraform's `docker_image` resource only rebuilds when the image **name/version** or the build-context hash changes (see [`terraform/modules/sdv-container-images/main.tf`](../../terraform/modules/sdv-container-images/main.tf)). Both kinds of upgrade therefore **require a version bump** - Type A explicitly, Type B brings the bump with the upstream change.

---

<a id="how-the-image-pipeline-works"></a>

## How the image pipeline works

Both halves of the pipeline read from the **remote** branch named in `scm_repo_branch` in `terraform/env/terraform.tfvars`:

- The deployment script [`tools/scripts/deployment/container-deploy.sh`](../../tools/scripts/deployment/container-deploy.sh) **clones** that branch (via [`deploy.sh`](../../tools/scripts/deployment/deploy.sh)) before it builds images.
- Argo CD **syncs** the GitOps manifests from that **same** branch.

> [!WARNING]
> **Every change must be committed and pushed to that remote branch, or nothing rolls out.**
> If the branch/commit is not on the remote, Argo CD reports `ComparisonError: unable to resolve '<branch>' to a commit SHA`, stays on the old state, and your running pods keep the **vulnerable** image even though a patched image may already exist in the registry. This is the single most common mistake.

---

<a id="prerequisites"></a>

## Prerequisites

- You operate a **fork/mirror** and deploy from your own branch (see [deployment_guide.md - Fork the Repository](../deployment_guide.md#section-5d---fork-the-repository)). Below, `upstream` = the public Horizon repository; `origin` = your fork.
- The existing environment is healthy: Argo CD applications `Synced` and `Healthy`.
- You can run [`deploy.sh`](../../tools/scripts/deployment/deploy.sh) (native) or [`container-deploy.sh`](../../tools/scripts/deployment/container-deploy.sh) (containerized) from `tools/scripts/deployment/`.
- Tooling: Terraform `>= 1.14.2`, Docker, `gcloud`, `kubectl` (minimums enforced by `deploy.sh`).

---

<a id="worked-example"></a>

## Worked example: a multi-image CVE batch

A real remediation batch flagged **14** images. Classifying each as Type A or Type B drives the rest of this guide:

| Kind | Mechanism | Images (example) |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| **A - bump only (self-heal)** | bump `build_version` / `deploy_version` | `gerrit-post`, `gerrit-mcp-server-app`, `mtk-connect-post`, `grafana-post`, `keycloak-post-jenkins`, `keycloak-post-argocd`, `keycloak-post-grafana`, `keycloak-post-headlamp`, `keycloak-post-mcp-gateway-registry`, `keycloak-post-mtk-connect` |
| **B - code change** | Dockerfile / base bump + version bump | `landingpage-app` (add `USER root` + `apk --no-cache upgrade`; nginx base `1.28.1` -> `1.28.3-alpine3.23`), `keycloak-post` (add `apk update && apk upgrade`), `keycloak-post-gerrit` (pull `openssh-client` from Alpine [edge](https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/main) for `>= 10.3`), `mtk-connect-post-key` (base -> `python:3.13-slim-bookworm`) |

> [!NOTE]
> The split above is specific to this batch. **Derive your own:** for each flagged image, check whether a fresh rebuild already lands the required version. If yes, it is Type A; if not, it is Type B.

---

<a id="section-1---version-bump-upgrade"></a>

## Section #1 - Version-bump upgrade (no code change)

This is the **Type A** path. It can be done on your **current** Horizon version, with no upstream pull.

1. On your fork's deployment branch, edit [`terraform/modules/base/locals.tf`](../../terraform/modules/base/locals.tf). For **each flagged Type A image**, bump **both** versions, e.g. `1.0.0` -> `1.0.1`:

   ```hcl
   "gerrit-post" = {
     directory      = "gerrit"
     build_version  = "1.0.1"   # tag Terraform builds + pushes to Artifact Registry
     deploy_version = "1.0.1"   # tag Argo CD deploys / post-jobs consume
   }
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Bump **both** `build_version` and `deploy_version`. Bumping only `build_version` builds a new image that never gets deployed.

2. **Commit and push** to the remote branch referenced by `scm_repo_branch` (substitute your own ticket ID):

   ```bash
   git add terraform/modules/base/locals.tf
   git commit -m "<TICKET-ID>: bump <images> to <new-version> to clear scanner findings"
   git push origin <your-branch>
   ```

3. Deploy (builds fresh `no_cache` images and pushes them to your registry):

   ```bash
   ./container-deploy.sh --apply      # or: ./deploy.sh --apply
   ```

4. Argo CD detects the changed manifests on the branch and rolls out:
   - long-running **Deployments** move to the new tag (`imagePullPolicy: Always`), and
   - **post-job** sync hooks re-run at the new tag.

5. **Verify** the running packages - see [Section #4 - Testing](#section-4---testing).

Because these Dockerfiles already `apk`/`apt upgrade` and builds are `no_cache=true`, the rebuilt image contains the latest patched packages automatically - no source edit needed.

---

<a id="section-2---code-change-upgrade"></a>

## Section #2 - Code-change upgrade (pull a newer release)

This is the **Type B** path. The fixes are in the platform **source** and ship in a later Horizon release. Bring them into your fork with one of:

- **Cherry-pick (most surgical - recommended for a single security batch):** take only the fix commit(s).
  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git cherry-pick <fix-commit-sha> [<more-shas>...]
  ```
- **Merge (preserves history; brings the whole release):** expect conflicts in `terraform.tfvars`, Dockerfiles, GitOps.
  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git merge <upstream-release-branch-or-tag>
  ```
- **Rebase (linear history; riskier on a shared/deployed branch - rewrites commits):**
  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git rebase <upstream-release-branch-or-tag>
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> The release-to-release [upgrade guides](README.md#upgrade-guides) document `git fetch / checkout / pull` onto a release branch and then **manually** aligning `terraform/env/terraform.tfvars` against the new `terraform.tfvars.sample`. They do **not** prescribe a merge/rebase strategy for a customized fork - the three options above fill that gap. After integrating, re-align your `terraform.tfvars` with the new sample (for example, a recent release renamed `enable_arm64` to `enable_arm64_dedicated_subnet`).

The upstream change already carries the bumped versions for the Type B images. After integrating and pushing, deploy and verify exactly as in [Section #1](#section-1---version-bump-upgrade) (steps 2-5).

Type B specifics worth validating after rollout (from the example batch):
- `keycloak-post-gerrit`: `openssh` comes from the Alpine **edge** branch (which also bumps **musl** image-wide) - sanity-check SSH and the Node runtime.
- `mtk-connect-post-key`: now on **Python 3.13** - sanity-check the job/script runs.
- `landingpage-app`: nginx base moved to `1.28.3-alpine3.23` and OS packages are patched.

<a id="section-3---applying-both"></a>

## Section #3 - Applying both: together or separately

- **Together (recommended once the target release is available):** pull the upstream release ([Section #2](#section-2---code-change-upgrade)). It already includes the version bumps for **all** flagged images (Type A *and* Type B), so a **single** `--apply` + push remediates everything.
- **Separately / phased (recommended when you cannot take the full release yet):**
  1. **Now:** run [Section #1](#section-1---version-bump-upgrade) on your current version - immediately clears the self-healing (Type A) images.
  2. **Later:** run [Section #2](#section-2---code-change-upgrade) for the code-change (Type B) images after you adopt the target release.

---

<a id="section-4---testing"></a>

## Section #4 - Testing container image security upgrades in an existing environment

Use this to validate security upgrades against an **existing, older** environment — whether you applied **Type A only** (version bump), **Type B only** (code change), or **both** ([Section #3](#section-3---applying-both)). Validation is by **direct package probing with `kubectl`**, so you do not depend on the scanner's cadence to know whether the fix landed.

> [!NOTE]
> **Scope: all 14 flagged images.** The `probe` command package-checks every image from the [worked example](#worked-example) — 10 Type A (rebuild-only) and 4 Type B (code-change). Run it **at any time** for any tag; save output with `-o` and `diff` snapshots yourself when comparing before/after. If you are testing a **phased Type A-only** rollout, remove the Type B image names from the script's `ALPINE_IMAGES` / `DEBIAN_IMAGES` lists first.

> [!NOTE]
> **Test on an older env, not a fresh one.** A freshly deployed environment auto-pulls the latest packages anyway, so it cannot demonstrate the "stale -> patched" delta. An **existing older** environment still carries the flagged versions, so it is the only true test bed.

<a id="section-4-test-script"></a>

### Test script

All probe, Argo CD, and spot-check commands are in:

[`tools/scripts/container-images/container-image-version-bump-test.sh`](../../tools/scripts/container-images/container-image-version-bump-test.sh)

**Commands:** `probe` (main — run anytime), `argocd`, `spot-check`, `cleanup`.

Make it executable, set your environment, then run:

```bash
chmod +x tools/scripts/container-images/container-image-version-bump-test.sh

export PROJECT=<PROJECT_ID>
export REGION=<gcp-region>          # e.g. us-central1
export CTX=connectgateway_${PROJECT}_${REGION}_sdv-cluster

gcloud container fleet memberships get-credentials sdv-cluster --project="${PROJECT}"
kubectl config use-context "${CTX}"

# Before upgrade — save a snapshot (optional: add --with-argocd)
./tools/scripts/container-images/container-image-version-bump-test.sh probe --tag 1.0.0 --with-argocd -o before_1.0.0.txt

# ... Section #4b: bump, push, deploy ...

# After upgrade — probe again and compare yourself
./tools/scripts/container-images/container-image-version-bump-test.sh probe --tag 1.0.1 -o after_1.0.1.txt
diff -u before_1.0.0.txt after_1.0.1.txt

./tools/scripts/container-images/container-image-version-bump-test.sh argocd --tag 1.0.1
./tools/scripts/container-images/container-image-version-bump-test.sh spot-check --tag 1.0.1
./tools/scripts/container-images/container-image-version-bump-test.sh cleanup
```

Pass `--help` for all flags. The script ships with all **14** images from the worked example; edit `ALPINE_IMAGES` / `DEBIAN_IMAGES` at the top if your CVE batch differs.

<a id="section-4a---probe"></a>

### Section #4a - Probe package versions at a tag

```bash
./tools/scripts/container-images/container-image-version-bump-test.sh probe --tag <TAG> [-o snapshot.txt] [--with-argocd]
```

This spins up ephemeral pods from all **14 flagged images** at `:<TAG>` in your registry and prints the flagged OS package versions. Use `-o` to save output; omit it to print to stdout. Add `--with-argocd` to include the image references Argo CD is deploying (useful before an upgrade).

Run once before the upgrade (`--tag 1.0.0`) and again after (`--tag 1.0.1`) when validating a rollout. You can also run `probe` anytime to audit the current state of images in the registry.

<a id="section-4b---bump-push-deploy"></a>

### Section #4b - Bump, push, deploy

In [`terraform/modules/base/locals.tf`](../../terraform/modules/base/locals.tf), bump `build_version` **and** `deploy_version` for **every flagged image** you are testing (all 14 for a full remediation, or Type A only for a phased test — see scope note above), then commit, push, and deploy:

```bash
git add terraform/modules/base/locals.tf
git commit -m "TEST: bump flagged images to ${NEW_TAG} (security upgrade validation)"
git push origin <your-test-branch>

./container-deploy.sh --apply      # or: ./deploy.sh --apply
```

> The push is mandatory - Terraform clones, and Argo CD syncs, from the **remote** branch.

<a id="section-4c---confirm-argocd"></a>

### Section #4c - Confirm Argo CD rolled out

```bash
./tools/scripts/container-images/container-image-version-bump-test.sh argocd --tag <TAG>
```

Expect `sync=Synced`, `health=Healthy`, `rev=<a commit SHA>`, and **no** `ComparisonError`. If you see `unable to resolve '<branch>' to a commit SHA`, your branch/commit is not on the remote - push it. With `--tag`, the script also lists workloads referencing that tag.

<a id="section-4d---compare"></a>

### Section #4d - Compare snapshots (optional)

After running `probe` before and after the upgrade, compare the saved files:

```bash
diff -u before_1.0.0.txt after_1.0.1.txt
```

Every flagged package should have moved from its old version to the patched one. Example deltas from the worked batch:

| Image / package | BEFORE | AFTER |
|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Alpine `curl` (most images) | `8.17.x-r*` | `8.19.0-r0` |
| Alpine `libssl3` / `libcrypto3` | `3.5.5-r0` | `3.5.6-r0` |
| Alpine `vim` | older | `>= 9.2.0321-r0` |
| Debian `libssl3` / `openssl` | older `~deb12u*` | latest `~deb12u*` |
| **landingpage-app** `nginx` | `1.28.1-r1` | `1.28.3-r1` |
| **landingpage-app** `libexpat` / `libpng` | `2.7.3` / `1.6.54` | `2.7.5-r0` / `1.6.58-r1` |
| **keycloak-post-gerrit** `openssh` | `10.2_p1-r0` | `10.3_p1-r0` |
| **mtk-connect-post-key** Python | `3.12.x` | `3.13.x` |

<a id="section-4e---live-spot-check"></a>

### Section #4e - Live-workload spot check

Probing `:$NEW_TAG` proves the **registry image** is patched. To prove the **running** workload was actually rolled:

```bash
./tools/scripts/container-images/container-image-version-bump-test.sh spot-check --tag <TAG>
```

By default this checks:
- **landingpage** Deployment (namespace `horizon`) — Type B; nginx + Alpine packages in the running pod
- **gerrit-mcp-server** Deployment (namespace `gerrit`) — Type A; Debian openssl packages
- **mtk-connect-api-key-config** CronJob (namespace `mtk-connect`) — Type B; forced one-off run on Python 3.13 image

Override with `--horizon-ns`, `--gerrit-ns`, `--mtk-connect-ns`, `--mtk-cronjob`, or pass `--skip-cronjob` to skip the CronJob step.

> [!NOTE]
> Argo CD post-job **sync hooks** (e.g. `keycloak-post-*`) run during sync and are auto-deleted on success; the parent app being `Synced/Healthy` confirms they completed at the new tag.

**Cleanup:**

```bash
./tools/scripts/container-images/container-image-version-bump-test.sh cleanup
```

**What this proves:** the images in the registry contain patched packages for **all 14 flagged images** at the tag you probed, Argo CD rolled them out, and long-running workloads plus the `mtk-connect-post-key` CronJob are running the expected tag. Post-job sync hooks are confirmed by Argo CD `Synced/Healthy` plus a `probe` at the new tag.

## Common pitfalls

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Argo CD `ComparisonError: unable to resolve '<branch>' to a commit SHA`; pods stay on old image | Branch/commit not pushed to remote | `git push origin <branch>` |
| New image in registry but running pods unchanged | Bumped `build_version` only | Also bump `deploy_version` |
| Nothing rebuilds after deploy | Reused the same tag | Bump the version ([Section #1](#section-1---version-bump-upgrade)) or pull the upstream change ([Section #2](#section-2---code-change-upgrade)) |
| Old-tag `Completed` Job/CronJob pods still present | Historical job runs | Harmless; they age out via the job history limit |
