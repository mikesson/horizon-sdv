# Storage GCS Manager

Helm chart path in this repository: `gitops/modules/storage-gcs-module` (synced by Module Manager as Argo CD Application `mod-storage-gcs` when enabled from the Developer Portal as catalog module **`storage-gcs`**).

Project **GCS buckets** `{project_id}-aaos` and `{project_id}-openbsw` are provisioned by **Terraform** (`terraform/modules/base/main.tf`, module `sdv-gcs`). **`{project_id}-sample-workloads-data`** is declared by **`sample-data`** as a **`GCSBucket`** CR reconciled by this operator (enable this module before **sample-data**; see `gitops/modules/sample-data-module`). **`{project_id}-argo-workflows`** is provisioned by platform GitOps KCC (`gitops/templates/argo-workflows-bucket.yaml`, `deletion-policy: abandon`). Terraform no longer manages that bucket: `removed { from = module.sdv_gcs_argo_workflows ... destroy = false }` in `terraform/modules/base/main.tf` drops it from state without deleting GCP objects (or use `terraform state rm` on the old address if needed). **Cluster-mode** `ConfigConnector` is platform GitOps in `gitops/templates/config-connector.yaml` (root `horizon-sdv` app, main env only).

Disabling **storage-gcs** is blocked while **sample-data** is enabled (hard dependent). Disable **sample-data** first; that CR uses `deletionPolicy: Delete`, so the operator empties and deletes `{project_id}-sample-workloads-data`. Other CRs default to **Retain** (GCP bucket is kept).

Additional buckets can be created dynamically by applying more **`GCSBucket`** resources in the manager namespace.

The **Go** binary (`controller-runtime`) reconciles **`GCSBucket`** CRs and serves an internal **ClusterIP** REST API on port **8443** (TLS). Kubelet probes use plain HTTP on **8080** (`/health` only).

### Security (in-cluster API)

- **NetworkPolicy:** ingress on `:8080` is limited to kubelet probe sources on node primary CIDRs (`config.probeSourceCIDRs`). Ingress on `:8443` is limited to pods in `{prefix}workflows` labeled `horizon-sdv.io/storage-gcs-api-client: "true"`. There is no ports-only (open-to-all) ingress rule. Chart defaults are `10.1.0.0/24` and `10.2.0.0/24`; production values come from Terraform `nodes_range` / `arm64_nodes_range` via root GitOps → Module Manager **MODULE_CONFIG** (`probeSourceCIDRs`). Wrong CIDRs cause silent probe failures under horizon default-deny.
- **TLS:** HTTPS on `:8443` with cluster-generated CA (`storage-gcs-module-api-tls`). Workflow clients mount `ca.crt` and set `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`.
- **Authentication:** all `/api/v1/*` routes and `/ready` require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Secret `storage-gcs-module-api-token` maps each caller to a current token and an optional previous token (rotation overlap). Horizon holds the full map (`tokens.json`); workflows only get caller `storage-gcs-internal`. Keys are generated once and preserved across syncs (`lookup`). `/health` stays unauthenticated for kubelet probes. API logs `caller=` and `token=current|previous` on each authenticated request. Invalid `tokens.json` fails closed (pod does not start; no fallback to the legacy token).
- **Bucket allowlist:** requests are allowed only for buckets in `ALLOWED_BUCKETS` (Helm `config.allowedBuckets`, project-prefixed by default: `{project}-aaos`, `{project}-openbsw`, `{project}-argo-workflows`) or for `spec.bucketName` of a **`GCSBucket`** CR. The name must be `{projectId}-...`. Others return `403`. **`ValidatingAdmissionPolicy`** rejects invalid `GCSBucket` specs at admission (prefix + no `deletionPolicy: Delete` on platform buckets).

Do not call the HTTP API from arbitrary pods; use **`storage-gcs-upload`** (`templateRef`) which authenticates as caller `storage-gcs-internal`.

Source: `terraform/modules/sdv-container-images/images/storage-gcs-module/storage-gcs-module-app` (built as image `storage-gcs-module-app`).

Registered in the Module Manager catalog (`gitops/apps/module-manager/templates/module-catalog.yaml`). Enable from the Developer Portal on the **main** environment only (chart templates are skipped when `config.isSubEnvironment` is true). Operator and API deploy to the `horizon` namespace (with optional name prefix). Image ref is merged from Module Manager `MODULE_CONFIG` (`config.containerImages.storageGcsModule`).

**Argo Workflows:** child Application `mod-storage-gcs-argo-workflows` deploys **`storage-gcs-upload`** (`horizon-sdv.io/expose: "false"` — not listed in the Developer Portal catalog; other modules use `templateRef`, templates **`upload`** and **`resumable-upload`**) and **`storage-gcs-module-internal`** into `{namespacePrefix}workflows` (`gitops/modules/storage-gcs-module/argo-workflows`). **`storage-gcs-upload`** is the only supported entry for other modules; callers must pass **`bucket`** (GCS bucket name) and **`objectPath`**. This module does **not** hardcode client buckets (e.g. sample-data’s `{project_id}-sample-workloads-data` is supplied by the sample chart). **`resumable-upload`** streams zero-filled chunks via the resumable REST API (`POST/PUT /api/v1/resumable/...`) with per-chunk MiB/bytes/decimal-GB progress logging. Low-level REST calls live in **`storage-gcs-module-internal`** (`push-object`, `verify-object`); workflow pods are labelled `horizon-sdv.io/storage-gcs-api-client: "true"` and send `Authorization: Bearer` from Secret `storage-gcs-module-api-token` key `storage-gcs-internal`. Egress from `{prefix}workflows` to the API is allowed by platform network policy `allow-workflow-pods-to-storage-gcs-module`. Do not call the HTTP API directly from other workflow charts.

**Overview:** static HTML is served by nginx in namespace `storage-gcs-overview`. The operator and API remain in `horizon`.

## Workload Identity

GCP service account: `gke-storage-gcs-module-sa@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`  
Kubernetes: `horizon/storage-gcs-module` (main env).

Terraform (`sa13`): `roles/storage.admin` is bound with an IAM condition so it applies only to buckets named `{projectId}-*`. `storage.buckets.create` is a separate custom role (conditions cannot restrict create). `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` is granted **on this SA only** (`sa_roles`) so SignBlob works without project-wide TokenCreator.

## Debugging (GKE)

The runtime image is **distroless** (no shell). Use an ephemeral debug container:

```bash
kubectl debug -it deploy/storage-gcs-module -n <namespace> --target=manager --image=busybox:1.36
```

Use your real namespace (for example `horizon` or a prefixed name from GitOps). The manager process runs as UID **65532** (`nonroot`).

## REST API (in-cluster)

Base URL: `https://storage-gcs-module.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:8443`

All `/api/v1/*` routes require header `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (Secret `storage-gcs-module-api-token`). `{bucket}` must be allowlisted (static `ALLOWED_BUCKETS` and/or a `GCSBucket` CR `spec.bucketName`).

Horizon Secret keys:

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `tokens.json` | `{"<caller>":{"current":"...","previous":"..."}}` — mounted as env `API_TOKENS` |
| `token` | Caller `default` (legacy / ad-hoc); optional env `API_BEARER_TOKEN` if `tokens.json` is empty |
| `storage-gcs-internal` | Workflow templates (`storage-gcs-module-internal`) |
| `token-previous` / `storage-gcs-internal-previous` | Optional overlap during rotation |

**Rotate one caller** (does not change other callers). Helm owns `tokens.json` from the per-caller Secret keys — patch those keys, not `tokens.json` by hand:

1. Copy that caller’s current Secret key to the matching `*-previous` key (`token` → `token-previous`, `storage-gcs-internal` → `storage-gcs-internal-previous`).
2. Write a new value into the current key.
3. On the next GitOps sync Helm rewrites `tokens.json` and the Deployment rolls (`checksum/api-token`). For an immediate cutover, write the same map into `tokens.json` and `kubectl rollout restart deploy/storage-gcs-module`.
4. After clients use the new current token, delete the `*-previous` key and sync (or restart) again.

To revoke one caller, delete its keys from the Secret and restart; other callers keep working.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/health` | Liveness and Kubernetes readiness probes (fast; no auth) |
| GET | `/ready` | Optional deep check: default bucket reachable via GCS (not used by probes; can be slow; **requires auth**) |
| POST | `/api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/objects` | Multipart: form field `object_path` + `file` |
| GET | `/api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/objects/{object_path...}` | Download object (supports HTTP `Range`) |
| POST | `/api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/packages` | Multipart: `object_path` + repeated `file` → streams ZIP into GCS |
| GET | `/api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/objects-meta/{object_path...}` | Object metadata (`object_path` may contain `/`) |
| GET | `/api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/objects-meta-raw/{object_path...}` | Raw metadata (includes custom `metadata` map) |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/objects-meta/{object_path...}` | Update raw metadata (contentType/cacheControl/custom metadata) |
| POST | `/api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/objects/filter` | Query objects by path/wildcards and metadata filters |
| POST | `/api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/objects-meta/batch-update` | Add/update metadata on filtered objects |
| POST | `/api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/objects-meta/batch-remove` | Remove selected or all metadata from filtered objects |
| POST | `/api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/objects-storage-class/list` | List storage classes for matching objects |
| POST | `/api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/objects-storage-class/batch-update` | Change storage class for filtered objects |
| POST | `/api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/objects/batch-delete` | Delete filtered objects (`dryRun` supported) |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/objects/{object_path...}` | Delete object |
| POST | `/api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/signed-urls` | Mint **GCS V4 signed URL** (JSON body below). Uses IAM `signBlob` as `gke-storage-gcs-module-sa` (override with `GCS_SIGNED_URL_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`). Default TTL **48h**, max **168h** (cap **7d**); configure via Helm `config.signedUrl` or env `GCS_SIGNED_URL_DEFAULT_EXPIRY` / `GCS_SIGNED_URL_MAX_EXPIRY` (Go durations, e.g. `48h`). |

**Signed URL request body:** `{"objectPath":"path/to/key","method":"GET"|"PUT","expiresInSeconds":<optional>,"contentType":"<optional for PUT>"}`

## Resumable uploads (big files)

This API supports two options for big files:

- **Streamed upload**: `POST /api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/objects` streams to GCS with a GCS chunk size.
- **Explicit resumable sessions** (GCS JSON API): start a session, then send chunks with `Content-Range`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/api/v1/resumable/buckets/{bucket}/objects` | Start session (`{"objectPath":"...","contentType":"...","metadata":{...}}`) → returns `uploadId` |
| PUT | `/api/v1/resumable/uploads/{uploadId}` | Send bytes with `Content-Range` |
| GET | `/api/v1/resumable/uploads/{uploadId}` | Query session status |

## GCSBucket (bucket lifecycle)

| Field | Notes |
|-------|--------|
| `spec.bucketName` | Global GCS bucket name (required). Must be `{projectId}-...`. |
| `spec.location` | Region or multi-region (required; must match an existing bucket’s location). |
| `spec.uniformBucketLevelAccess` | Optional; defaults to `true`. |
| `spec.labels` | Optional GCP bucket labels. |
| `spec.deletionPolicy` | `Retain` (default) or `Delete`. Retain keeps the GCP bucket when the CR is removed. Delete empties all object generations then deletes the bucket. **Admission** rejects `Delete` on platform buckets (`-aaos`, `-openbsw`, `-argo-workflows`). |

**Troubleshooting `storage.buckets.get` 403:** GCS bucket names are **global**. A bare name like `sample-workloads-data` is often already owned by another project; the operator then gets *Permission denied* (not *not found*) when calling `Attrs()`. Use project-scoped names (`{project_id}-sample-workloads-data`, same pattern as Terraform buckets `-aaos` / `-openbsw`). Also confirm Terraform applied `gke-storage-gcs-module-sa` with prefix-conditioned `roles/storage.admin` (`terraform/env/main.tf`, `sa13`) and Workload Identity on `horizon/storage-gcs-module`.

**Migrating from GitOps-managed `-aaos` / `-openbsw`:** If `GCSBucket` CRs named `aaos` or `openbsw` already exist, delete the CRs only when you intend to drop operator management. Default `deletionPolicy: Retain` keeps the GCP bucket; set `Delete` only if you want the operator to empty and remove it. Prefer adopting under Terraform before deleting those CRs if you need to keep the data. Then run `terraform apply` to import or adopt the buckets under Terraform state.

Example (dynamic bucket):

```yaml
apiVersion: gcsmanager.horizon.io/v1alpha1
kind: GCSBucket
metadata:
  name: my-team-data
  namespace: horizon
spec:
  bucketName: my-project-my-team-data
  location: US
  uniformBucketLevelAccess: true
  deletionPolicy: Retain
```

## Utility migration from Jenkins

The former Jenkins GCS utility jobs are now expected to use the `storage-gcs-module` API directly. The batch endpoints accept object paths relative to the bucket or `gs://bucket/...` paths, support wildcard matching (`*`, `?`), and cover:

- listing object metadata
- filtering by specific / any / no metadata
- adding / removing metadata on matching objects
- listing / updating storage class on matching objects
- deleting matching objects with optional dry-run

## Local build

```bash
cd terraform/modules/sdv-container-images/images/storage-gcs-module/storage-gcs-module-app
go build -o manager ./cmd/manager
```
